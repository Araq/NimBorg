NimBorg
=======

The goal of NimBorg is to assimilate multiple programming languages into the
Nim ecosystem. In other words, I aspire to develop here high-level interfaces
between Nim and other languages. Currently we have very basic support for
Python and Lua.

The current state of the bindings can be observed by looking at the 'test' directory
for each of the languages. There's also a "usage.txt" file under nimborg/py and under
nimborg/lua, but it might occasionally get out-of-date, so the tests are more reliable.

This project is extremely young and the API may change without notice. If you
use something and it stops working, you're invited to send a message to biosap
at gmail dot com and I'll try to help you adapt to the change.
