NimBorg
=======

The goal of NimBorg is to assimilate multiple programming languages into the
Nimrod ecosystem. In other words, I aspire to develop here high-level interfaces 
between Nimrod and other languages. Currently we have very basic support for 
python and lua.

The current state of the bindings can be observed by looking at the 'test' directory
for each of the languages. There's also a "usage.txt" file under nimborg/py and under 
nimborg/lua, but it might occasionally get out-of-date, so the tests are more reliable.

This project is extremely young and the API may change without notice. If you 
use something and it stops working, you're invited to send a message to biosap 
at gmail dot com and I'll try to help you adapt to the change.
