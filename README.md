NimBorg
=======

The goal of NimBorg is to assimilate multiple programming languages into the
Nimrod ecosystem. In other words, I aspire to develop here high-level interfaces 
between Nimrod and other languages. Currently we have very basic support for 
python and lua.

The current state of the bindings can be observed by looking at the 'test' directory
for each of the languages. 

This project is extremely young and the API can change without notice. If you 
use something and it stops working, you're invited to send a message to biosap 
at gmail dot com and I'll try to help you adapt to the change.
