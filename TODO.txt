most urgently needed:
* functionality (e.g. call lua functions, override lua's dot)
* API docs
* internals docs

lower priority
* replace init_list etc. with py_list as suggested by renesac
* pass nimrod functions to the foreign runtime? (might be a mess for GC)
* efficient access to numpy arrays (suggested by renesac)
* read through the Julia discussion here and pick some ideas
