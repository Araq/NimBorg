most urgently needed:
* babel support
* internals docs
* "override the dot" for lua (that is, implement ~ for PLuaRef)

lower priority
* change the python API to work more like the lua API. The PyRefs and the PyContexts 
should hold a reference to the Interpreter so that it isn't collected before they are.
* pass nimrod functions to the foreign runtime? (might be a mess for GC)
* efficient access to numpy arrays (suggested by renesac)
* read through the Julia discussion here and pick some ideas
